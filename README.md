This repository is used for PhD work on the evolution of genetic diseases in European populations over the last 10,000 years. It is named after a cat, not the emperor.

The file msprime_sim_to_fs.py runs a simulation of chromosome 3 evolving in separate European populations, with migration rates, merges, and pop sizes approximating that reported in the literature. It converts the output of this simulation into files that are suitable for running with FINESTRUCTURE programme.
