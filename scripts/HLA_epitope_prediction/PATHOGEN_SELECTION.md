## Reference Strain Rationale

All strains selected are:
1. **Well-annotated** reference genomes
2. **Historically relevant** to European populations
3. **Standard references** in the literature
4. **Complete genomes** available

For pathogens with high strain variation (e.g., Strep pneumoniae, HIV), we selected the most common or best-studied reference strain.

---

## Analysis Strategy

### **Phase 1**: All 20 pathogens (current scope)
### **Phase 2**: Compare HLA binding profiles across:
- Time periods (ancient vs. recent)
- Geographic distribution (north vs. south)
- Transmission mode (respiratory, vector, zoonotic)
- Disease severity (mortality rates)

### **Phase 3**: Correlate with:
- European HLA allele frequencies
- Geographic clines in HLA distribution
- Known HLA disease associations
- Ancient DNA data from European skeletons

---

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Identify pathogen-specific HLA signatures**
2. **Compare shared vs. unique epitopes** across pathogens
3. **Test hypotheses** about HLA frequency distributions in Europe
4. **Prioritize alleles** showing strongest pathogen associations
5. **Generate predictions** for future pathogen HLA studies

---

## Computational Considerations

- **Total pathogens**: 20
- **Expected runtime** (conservative mode, step=3): ~15-30 hours (depends on system)
- **Expected runtime** (comprehensive mode, step=1): ~150-300 hours
- **Storage**: ~50-100 GB for all results
- **Memory**: 20-40 GB RAM (with n_jobs=20-40)

**Recommendation**: Run overnight or over a weekend with conservative settings first, then selectively re-run interesting pathogens in comprehensive mode.
